REM This is a placeholder for a large DICOM file (e.g., one slice of a ~2GB dataset).
REM Actual DICOM binary data should reside in this file.
REM For testing purposes, this file might be several megabytes to hundreds of megabytes.
REM The full dataset (e.g., "dicom_2gb_dataset_1") would contain multiple such files.
